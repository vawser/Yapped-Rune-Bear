# Yapped - Rune Bear
An editor for Elden Ring param files, which determine the properties of items, attacks, effects, enemies, objects, and a whole lot more. 
For detailed instructions, please refer to the included readme.

Requires .NET 4.7.2 - Windows 10 users should already have this.

Thanks to TKGP for the [original version](https://github.com/JKAnderson/Yapped).

# Files
If you are only interested in Yapped for modding, you only need to extract the contents of Yapped/bin/x64/Debug/, everything else is not needed.

# Warning
As far as we know, in Elden Ring any edits to the regulation file (where params are stored) will trigger anticheat, including simply opening it and resaving it.
Only use modified params in offline mode. Back up your save file and restore it before going online again if you're doing anything that could affect it.
